# Login App
Full-stack login application developed using Angular (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and Supabase (database/auth).

## Features
- User registration
- Login
- "Cool" checkbox (users may check this off after login)
- Supabase authentication

## Important Note
Current API does not implement authentication middleware. Functions in preferencesControllers.js rely on sending userIDs through request bodies.

This issue must be addressed before development concludes.
